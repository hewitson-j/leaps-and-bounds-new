          Ms. Melanie is the best and most nurturing teacher a kid could have. I
          felt 100% comfortable sending my children to her every day. They loved
          everything about Leaps and Bounds and so did I! We will miss Ms.
          Melanie very much, but my kids are very ready for the next step of
          Kindergarten thanks to her!

          Melanie is truly amazing. Her hard work and passion for teaching shows
          in everything she does. Tonight was my little girls graduation and it
          makes me so sad that we won’t get to send her everyday. I knew my
          daughter was in the best preschool as not one day went by that she
          didn’t come out with a smile on her face. The curriculum Melanie uses
          is incredible. We are going to miss Leaps and Bounds so much next year
          but I know she has had an incredible start to her learning because of
          you, Melanie. Thank you for everything you have done this year with
          Lucy.

          My Daughter has thrived here and loves going to school. She has made
          huge progress both academically and socially. I love that Ms. Melanie
          does play based learning and you can tell that she cares about and
          loves her students. The class size is small so that you child gets the
          attention they need. She is wonderful at communicating with parents, I
          never feel like I don't know whats going on. She always has such fun
          and creative stations and projects for the students. I will be sending
          my son here when he is old enough and would recommend leaps and bounds
          to everybody.

          It’s been a pleasure watching my little girl flourish under Miss
          Melanie’s care. She is an incredible and patient teacher, who knows
          just how to cater to each individual child’s needs! A+++++++++
