          If you're looking for an incredible preschool look no further!! My son
          just finished and I cannot say enough great things. Mrs. Melanie has
          such a kind gentle spirit about her. My son had many rough mornings
          but she was always super patient and kind. I loved the curriculum she
          used. So many fun and creative crafts they did. The Christmas family
          event was so fun too as well as the graduation. I wish she taught
          Kindergarten too so we could stay another year!

          This program has been such a blessing for our son. He has grown so
          much in his knowledge, social skills, attention and learning skills,
          and his confidence and curiosity. He truly seems well prepared to
          enter into kindergarten, and may even be advanced beyond his age,
          thanks to Leaps and Bounds. I even learn a thing or two on the drive
          home! Ms. Melanie has created such an engaging, fun, and intentional
          program, and she truly cares about the success of each child. The kids
          absolutely love her, and you can easily tell they’ve all created bonds
          with each other and with her. I can’t recommend it enough.

          Mrs. Melanie is so special to our family! The progress our daughter
          has made is so far beyond an academic realm. Her character, her self
          confidence, her socialization, her independence. What Mrs. Melanie
          does is more than any traditional academic center could provide. We
          cannot recommend her highly enough. We’ve loved getting to know the
          classmates and their families. Having a small class makes this
          experience unique and wonderful for families starting their academic
          journey with their young children. We are confident our daughter will
          be more than prepared for kindergarten and beyond—in academics,
          socialization, independence/autonomy, and so much more. We’ve loved
          how communicative Melanie is with us as parents with her concerns or
          even accolades of our child. And she is our biggest cheerleader from a
          parent to a parent. Gratitude forever for this wonderful woman and
          what she has built.

          With preschool being the first introduction our child would have to
          education outside our home, we were looking for a program that would
          stimulate our daughter's desire to learn in a manner she would enjoy.
          Melanie's program has exceeded all of our expectations. We have seen
          our child grow, not only academically, but most importantly in her
          character and social interactions with her peers. Hands down and
          without any reservations, we recommend Leaps & Bounds for your
          preschool needs.

          If you’re thinking of sending your child here, don’t hesitate and DO
          IT! Melanie is so amazing, I honestly don’t have enough words to
          describe the impact she’s had on my son. This is his second year with
          her and he’s learned so much, intellectually, emotionally, physically,
          musically, etc. Every time my son talks about his “family”, Melanie is
          always included in that grouping. He truly sees her as his family and
          we do too! She’s kind and patient and loving and makes all of her
          students feel cared for while at school. I would absolutely recommend
          her as a preschool teacher, so much so that I will definitely be
          sending my daughter in a couple years!

          Ms. Melanie is the best and most nurturing teacher a kid could have. I
          felt 100% comfortable sending my children to her every day. They loved
          everything about Leaps and Bounds and so did I! We will miss Ms.
          Melanie very much, but my kids are very ready for the next step of
          Kindergarten thanks to her!

          Melanie is truly amazing. Her hard work and passion for teaching shows
          in everything she does. Tonight was my little girls graduation and it
          makes me so sad that we won’t get to send her everyday. I knew my
          daughter was in the best preschool as not one day went by that she
          didn’t come out with a smile on her face. The curriculum Melanie uses
          is incredible. We are going to miss Leaps and Bounds so much next year
          but I know she has had an incredible start to her learning because of
          you, Melanie. Thank you for everything you have done this year with
          Lucy.

          My Daughter has thrived here and loves going to school. She has made
          huge progress both academically and socially. I love that Ms. Melanie
          does play based learning and you can tell that she cares about and
          loves her students. The class size is small so that you child gets the
          attention they need. She is wonderful at communicating with parents, I
          never feel like I don't know whats going on. She always has such fun
          and creative stations and projects for the students. I will be sending
          my son here when he is old enough and would recommend leaps and bounds
          to everybody.

          It’s been a pleasure watching my little girl flourish under Miss
          Melanie’s care. She is an incredible and patient teacher, who knows
          just how to cater to each individual child’s needs! A+++++++++
