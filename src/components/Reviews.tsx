        {"\t"}Ms. Melanie is the best and most nurturing teacher a kid could
        have. I felt 100% comfortable sending my children to her every day. They
        loved everything about Leaps and Bounds and so did I! We will miss Ms.
        Melanie very much, but my kids are very ready for the next step of
        Kindergarten thanks to her!

        {"\t"}Melanie is truly amazing. Her hard work and passion for teaching
        shows in everything she does. Tonight was my little girls graduation and
        it makes me so sad that we won’t get to send her everyday. I knew my
        daughter was in the best preschool as not one day went by that she
        didn’t come out with a smile on her face. The curriculum Melanie uses is
        incredible. We are going to miss Leaps and Bounds so much next year but
        I know she has had an incredible start to her learning because of you,
        Melanie. Thank you for everything you have done this year with Lucy.

        {"\t"}My Daughter has thrived here and loves going to school. She has
        made huge progress both academically and socially. I love that Ms.
        Melanie does play based learning and you can tell that she cares about
        and loves her students. The class size is small so that you child gets
        the attention they need. She is wonderful at communicating with parents,
        I never feel like I don't know whats going on. She always has such fun
        and creative stations and projects for the students. I will be sending
        my son here when he is old enough and would recommend leaps and bounds
        to everybody.

          It’s been a pleasure watching my little girl flourish under Miss
          Melanie’s care. She is an incredible and patient teacher, who knows
          just how to cater to each individual child’s needs! A+++++++++
