    just finished and I cannot say enough great things. Mrs. Melanie has
    such a kind gentle spirit about her. My son had many rough mornings
    but she was always super patient and kind. I loved the curriculum she
    used. So many fun and creative crafts they did. The Christmas family
    event was so fun too as well as the graduation. I wish she taught
    Kindergarten too so we could stay another year!`,

    much in his knowledge, social skills, attention and learning skills,

    enter into kindergarten, and may even be advanced beyond his age,
    thanks to Leaps and Bounds. I even learn a thing or two on the drive
    home! Ms. Melanie has created such an engaging, fun, and intentional
    program, and she truly cares about the success of each child. The kids
    absolutely love her, and you can easily tell they’ve all created bonds
    with each other and with her. I can’t recommend it enough.`,

    has made is so far beyond an academic realm. Her character, her self
    confidence, her socialization, her independence. What Mrs. Melanie
    does is more than any traditional academic center could provide. We
    cannot recommend her highly enough. We’ve loved getting to know the
    classmates and their families. Having a small class makes this
    experience unique and wonderful for families starting their academic
    journey with their young children. We are confident our daughter will
    be more than prepared for kindergarten and beyond—in academics,
    socialization, independence/autonomy, and so much more. We’ve loved
    how communicative Melanie is with us as parents with her concerns or
    even accolades of our child. And she is our biggest cheerleader from a
    parent to a parent. Gratitude forever for this wonderful woman and
    what she has built.`,

    Melanie's program has exceeded all of our expectations. We have seen
    our child grow, not only academically, but most importantly in her
    character and social interactions with her peers. Hands down and
    without any reservations, we recommend Leaps & Bounds for your

    describe the impact she’s had on my son. This is his second year with
    her and he’s learned so much, intellectually, emotionally, physically,
    musically, etc. Every time my son talks about his “family”, Melanie is
    always included in that grouping. He truly sees her as his family and
    we do too! She’s kind and patient and loving and makes all of her
    students feel cared for while at school. I would absolutely recommend
    her as a preschool teacher, so much so that I will definitely be
    sending my daughter in a couple years!`,
