        I am passionate about teaching preschool! I have been working in the
        field of early childhood education for almost 20 years beginning in high
        school. I am a member of NAEYC, CAEYC and am licensed with the state of
        Colorado. After 10 years of working in the public school system in
        Nevada I moved to Colorado Springs and began working at a childcare
        center and did so for over two years. At that time, I decided to open my
        own preschool classroom.

        I have been teaching preschool-age students in my home as a licensed
        family childcare provider for over five years. My husband and I have
        been married 9 years. We have a beautifully blended family with six
        children whose ages range from 17- 25.
        <br />

        We have one dog named Rosie and a cat named Ophelia. I enjoy being able
        to teach children from my home. I love working with them and seeing
        their faces light up when they learn something new! Iâ€™m excited to have
        your child join our class and look forward to teaching, as well as
        learning from them. I truly believe each child has amazing potential and
        gifts already inside of them. Thank you for considering becoming a part
        of the Leaps & Bounds Preschool family!
