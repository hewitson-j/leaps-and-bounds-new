      <h2>About our Program</h2>
      <p>
        To provide each child with a healthy and happy Pre-K experience in a
        warm and loving Christian home environment and to ignite his/her
        excitement for future learning; to build self esteem, self confidence
        and self reliance. My approach to teaching is hands-on and play-based.
        Learning styles vary.
        <br />
        <br />I believe the best approach to learning is through all of the
        senses. I promote problem solving, positive social skills and
        communication every day. My curriculum includes studies of interest to
        the Pre-K child and I work hard to present these studies as well as
        necessary kindergarten and life skills in a meaningful way.
